            %ul

              %li Trends in Commute Behavior: Identified complex commute behavior, e.g. trip chaining (the ‘Starbucks Effect’), calculated mandatory and discretionary travel purposes during peak (Peak Travel), researched changes in commute behavior over the last half century (Commuting in America IV for AASHTO)
            %p
              Ms. McGuckin works extensively with many large national databases, and is especially well-known for her work with the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data series. She was on the team to collect and analyze the 2017 NHTS.  The change in sample and methods—address-based sample and web retrieval—makes her familiarity with the series integral to the interpretation of the new NHTS data. She developed the 2009 and 2017 NHTS “Summary of Travel Trends”.  In addition, she works extensively with NHTS add-ons, both states and local planners, to conduct research and leverage the add-on data for a range of local uses and analyses.
